Data Warehouse & Analytics Portfolio Project

Welcome to my Data Warehouse and Analytics Portfolio Project 👋

This repository is part of my learning journey into the data science and analytics field. I created this project to practice real-world concepts like data warehousing, SQL, ETL pipelines, and analytics — and to showcase these skills as part of my professional portfolio.

If you are also learning data analytics, data engineering, or SQL, I hope this project helps you understand how everything fits together in a practical way.

🏗️ Data Architecture (How the Data Is Organized)

In this project, I followed a commonly used industry approach called Medallion Architecture, which has three layers:

🥉 Bronze Layer

This is where the raw data lives.

Data is loaded as-is from CSV files into a SQL Server database.

No cleaning or transformations are done at this stage.

🥈 Silver Layer

This layer focuses on cleaning and improving data quality.

Tasks include fixing data types, handling missing values, and standardizing fields.

The goal is to prepare the data for analysis.

🥇 Gold Layer

This is the analytics-ready layer.

Data is modeled into fact and dimension tables (star schema).

This layer is used for reporting, dashboards, and business insights.

📖 Project Overview (What I Built and Learned)

This project covers the full journey from raw data to insights:

Designing a modern data warehouse using Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers

Building ETL pipelines using SQL

Creating fact and dimension tables for analytics

Writing SQL queries to analyze sales, customers, and products

🎯 Why This Project Matters for My Portfolio

This repository demonstrates hands-on experience with:

SQL development

Data warehousing concepts

Data modeling (star schema)

ETL processes

Analytical thinking using real datasets

It is designed to reflect how data projects are done in real organizations, even at an entry-level role.

🛠️ Tools & Resources Used (All Free)

Here are the tools and resources used in this project:

Datasets (datasets/): Raw CSV files used as source data

SQL Server Express: Free database engine to host the data warehouse

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): To write and run SQL queries

GitHub: Version control and portfolio hosting

Draw.io: For architecture diagrams, data models, and ETL flows

Notion: To plan tasks and track project progress

Notion Project Guide: Step-by-step breakdown of all project phases

🚀 Project Requirements & Goals
1️⃣ Data Warehouse (Data Engineering Part)

Goal:
Build a simple but structured data warehouse that combines sales data from multiple sources and supports analysis.

Key Points:

Data comes from two systems (ERP and CRM) in CSV format

Data is cleaned before analysis

Both sources are integrated into one analytical model

Only the latest data is used (no historical tracking)

The data model is documented for easy understanding

2️⃣ Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis Part)

Goal:
Use SQL to answer real business questions, such as:

How customers behave

Which products perform best

How sales change over time

These queries help turn raw data into useful business insights.

More details can be found in the project documentation.
